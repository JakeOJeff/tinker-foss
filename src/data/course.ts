        duration: "5 min",
        content: `**FOSS = Free and Open Source Software**

"Free" means freedom, not just cost. The Four Essential Freedoms:
â€¢ Freedom 0: Run the program for any purpose
â€¢ Freedom 1: Study and modify how it works
â€¢ Freedom 2: Redistribute copies
â€¢ Freedom 3: Share your modifications

**Examples you use daily:**
Linux, Firefox, VLC, WordPress, Android, Git

**Key Benefits:**
- Transparency: See exactly what software does
- Security: Community can audit and fix issues
- Innovation: Build on existing work
- Education: Learn from real production code
- Community: Solve problems together

FOSS powers the internet and represents collaborative value creation over restrictive ownership.`

        title: "Why Do We Need FOSS?",
        duration: "8 min",
        content: `**Breaking Digital Monopolies**
Proprietary software creates vendor lock-in. FOSS gives you freedom to choose and control your digital tools.

**Security Through Transparency**
Open source allows worldwide security auditing. Vulnerabilities get fixed faster than closed systems.

**Accelerated Innovation**
Developers build on existing work instead of reinventing. AI/ML advanced rapidly once frameworks went open source.

**Educational Value**
Learn from production-quality code. Study how complex systems actually work.

**Economic Benefits**
- Reduced licensing costs
- Faster development
- Shared infrastructure costs
- New business opportunities

**Real Success Stories:**
Apache powers millions of sites, Linux runs 96% of top servers, Git is used universally.

**The Alternative**
Without FOSS: Few companies control all software, innovation slows, your data becomes hostage to profit motives.

FOSS ensures technology serves users, not just shareholders.`

        title: "How to Start Contributing",
        duration: "10 min",
        content: `**You Don't Need to Be an Expert**
Beginners often provide the most valuable contributions by asking obvious questions and spotting confusing documentation.

**Types of Contributions:**
- **Documentation**: Fix typos, improve guides, add examples
- **Bug Reports**: Report issues with clear steps
- **Code**: Fix bugs, add features, improve performance
- **Design**: UI improvements, graphics, UX testing
- **Community**: Answer questions, help newcomers

**Finding Projects:**
- Start with tools you already use
- Look for "good first issue" labels on GitHub
- Check Up For Grabs or First Timers Only

**Basic Workflow:**
1. Choose a project you find interesting
2. Read README and contribution guidelines
3. Find a beginner-friendly issue
4. Comment on the issue before starting work
5. Fork â†’ Clone â†’ Branch â†’ Code â†’ Test â†’ Commit â†’ Push â†’ PR

**Best Practices:**
- Read contributing guidelines first
- Communicate before making large changes
- Follow existing code style
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Be patient with feedback

**Your First Contribution Checklist:**
â–¡ Find an interesting project
â–¡ Read all documentation
â–¡ Set up development environment
â–¡ Find beginner-friendly issue
â–¡ Communicate with maintainers
â–¡ Make and test changes
â–¡ Submit clear pull request
â–¡ Respond to feedback professionally

Every expert was once a beginner. Your first contribution doesn't need to be perfectâ€”it just needs to be a start.`

        duration: "8 min",
        content: `**The 80/20 Rule**
20% of code handles 80% of functionality. Find that critical 20% first.

**Layered Analysis Approach:**

**Layer 1: Overview (10 min)**
- README.md: What does it do?
- package.json: What dependencies?
- Directory structure: How organized?
- LICENSE: How can you use it?

**Layer 2: Architecture (30 min)**
- Entry points: index.html, main.js
- Configuration files
- Tests (often best documentation)
- Documentation folders

**Layer 3: Code Flow (1-2 hours)**
- Start from entry point
- Follow execution path
- Identify main data structures
- Understand core business logic

**Practical Techniques:**

**Grep-First Strategy:**
    grep -r "function main|class Main" .
    grep -r "config|settings" .
    grep -r "addEventListener|onclick" .

**HTML-First for Web Projects:**
- Start with main HTML file
- Follow linked CSS/JS files
- Use browser DevTools extensively

**When Overwhelmed:**
- Take breaks
- Draw diagrams
- Focus on your specific goal
- Ask questions in issues/forums

**Common Web Patterns:**
- Static sites: HTML + CSS + JS files
- SPAs: One HTML, dynamic JS routing
- Multi-page: Multiple HTML files

Remember: Understanding takes time. Build a mental model gradually, one component at a time.`

        title: "Black Box Problem-Solving",
        duration: "8 min",
        content: `**Black Box Concept**
Focus on what goes IN and what comes OUT, ignore internal implementation until needed.

**Why It's Powerful:**
- Reduces cognitive load
- Enables abstraction
- Breaks problems into manageable pieces

**Black Box Strategy:**
1. **Identify Problem Boundary**: What exactly needs fixing?
2. **Find Responsible Component**: Which part handles this?
3. **Understand Interface**: What inputs/outputs?
4. **Test the Box**: Can you reproduce the issue?
5. **Fix Within Box**: Keep changes isolated

**Example: Fixing Email Validation**
- Don't understand entire codebase
- Find form validation component
- Understand its inputs (form data) and outputs (valid/invalid)
- Focus only on email validation logic

**When to Open the Black Box:**
- Performance issues
- Complex bugs spanning components
- Learning/growth opportunities
- Major architectural changes

**Best Practices:**
- Design clear interfaces
- Maintain single responsibility
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document behavior

**Think in Layers**: Complex systems are built from simpler black boxes. Master this approach and even the largest codebases become manageable.`
