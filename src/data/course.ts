- **What is Git?**  
  Git is a *distributed version control system*. It keeps track of changes made to files, remembers every version, and allows collaboration.  

- **Why do developers use Git?**  
  - Undo mistakes by going back in history  
  - Work in teams without overwriting each other’s code  
  - Try new ideas safely in separate branches  
  - Share code online via platforms like GitHub  

- **Git vs GitHub:**  
  - **Git** is the tool installed on your computer to track changes.  
  - **GitHub** is a website where Git repositories are hosted and shared online.

    duration: "5 min",
    content: `
- **Download Git:** [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
  Choose the installer for your operating system.  

- **Verify Installation:**  
  Open a terminal (Command Prompt, Powershell, or bash) and type:  
  \`git --version\`  

- **Set your identity (needed for commits):**  
  \`git config --global user.name "Your Name"\`  
  \`git config --global user.email "you@example.com"\`  

- This tells Git who is making changes. Each commit will be tagged with your name and email.

    title: "Creating Your First Repository",
    duration: "4 min",
    content: `
- A *repository (repo)* is like a project folder managed by Git.  

- **Steps:**  
  1. Create a new folder: \`mkdir my-project && cd my-project\`  
  2. Initialize it as a Git repo: \`git init\`  
  3. Git will create a hidden \`.git\` folder that tracks changes.  

- **Check status anytime:**  
  \`git status\` → Shows which files are tracked or untracked.

    title: "Staging Changes (git add)",
    duration: "4 min",
    content: `
- Git works in 3 areas:  
  1. **Working Directory** → Your files on disk.  
  2. **Staging Area** → Files you’ve marked for the next commit.  
  3. **Repository** → The permanent history of commits.  

- **Stage a file:**  
  \`git add index.html\`  

- **Stage all files:**  
  \`git add .\`  

- Think of staging as "preparing a basket of changes before saving".

    duration: "5 min",
    content: `
- A *commit* is like a checkpoint in your project.  

- **Make a commit:**  
  \`git commit -m "Add homepage"\`  

- Each commit has:  
  - A unique ID (hash)  
  - Author name/email  
  - Commit message  
  - Snapshot of changes  

- **Good practice:** Write meaningful messages like "Fix login bug" instead of just "update".

- **See full history:**  
  \`git log\`  

- **Simplified one-line view:**  
  \`git log --oneline\`  

- Shows commit IDs and messages. Useful for finding specific changes.  

- Example:  
  \`a1b2c3 Add homepage\`  
  \`d4e5f6 Fix typo in README\`

    title: "Branches Explained",

    content: `
- A *branch* is like a copy of your project where you can make changes safely.  

- **Main Branch:** Usually called \`main\` (older projects may use \`master\`).  

- **Common Commands:**  
  - Create: \`git branch feature-login\`  
  - Switch: \`git checkout feature-login\`  
  - List: \`git branch\`  

- Branches allow multiple developers to work on features without touching the main code.

    title: "Merging Branches",
    duration: "5 min",

- Once your branch is ready, you can merge it into the main branch.  

- **Steps:**  
  1. Switch to main: \`git checkout main\`  
  2. Merge: \`git merge feature-login\`  

- If two people edited the same part of a file, you’ll get a *merge conflict*. Git will mark the file and ask you to decide which version to keep.  

- After resolving, commit again to finish the merge.

- A *remote* is a version of your repo stored online (e.g., GitHub).  

- **Add a remote:**  
  \`git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git\`  

- **Check remotes:**  
  \`git remote -v\`  

- This links your local repo to the GitHub repo.

  \`git push origin main\`  

- First push may require:  
  \`git push -u origin main\` → Sets "origin main" as default.  

- After this, you can just run \`git push\`.

  \`git pull origin main\`

  1. Create a new branch

- A common GitHub team workflow:

  5. Open a **Pull Request**
